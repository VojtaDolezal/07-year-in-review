# 07-year-in-review
This year has been very good to me so far and I am just glad, that every day I have a reason to be grateful for something. New work experiences, creating a lot of passion projects, new friends, new faces.
I believe there are more good experiences to come, but I cannot speak so much on 2024 since it just began.
# School
2023/2024 Was overall a challenging year, especially at the end of the second semester. Like many of my classmates, I had to write a bachelor's thesis, which was one hell of a challenge for me. 
I was never good at writing text, I am a visualist. I create static and dynamic pictures. Anyway I had a huge takeaway when it comes to discipline in this matter. Studying VŠKK brought me a lot of good friendships,
connections and experiences. On the other hand, I would not say that I learnt that much when it comes to video making field. If I had not started making comissions out of my skills, I wouldn't be able to make any 
progress relying only on this school. But as I have already mentioned, I have made friends with whom I could work together. We were employing one another and been able to make some good money too.
That's what I value the most. The networking. 

# Work
My work in 2024 was very interesting so far, better than last year, what makes me happy becasue there is a certain progress. This year I have collaborated with the organisation of Miss Czech Republic and created 
visual medallions for competing ladies, which are gonna be broadcasted on the finals in a big hall of Forum Karlín. I have also managed to work with a huge slovakian youtuber and influencer GogomanTV and we shot
a little instagram commercial for Pilsner Urquell. I also shot a few prom balls which is kinda my specialty, because I didn't have one, so it is always my pleasure to create a beautiful memory for somebody who 
has it.

# Life
This is a very wide topic to describe. But I just wanna say I'm grateful for everything and everybody that has come into my life and left my life. I learn every day. Not a long time ago I realized I'm still at the
phase where I'm trying to find myself, the real me, my dream job. I am still not sure about a lot of things. But I try to accept life's challenges and also pass them right. 
I lost a lot of people I knew this year. (RIP) Which is basically life letting me know to be happy and grateful for every good and bad thing I encounter.
